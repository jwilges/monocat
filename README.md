## Background
This utility aims to make integrating GitHub release steps in CI/CD pipelines simple.

## Supported Platforms
This utility is continuously unit tested on a GNU/Linux system with Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.

## Usage
Use the `GITHUB_API` environment variable to specify alternate GitHub API URLs;
the default value is [https://api.github.com](https://api.github.com).

## Prior Art
This utility was inspired by the [`gothub`](https://github.com/itchio/gothub)
utility from [itch.io](https://github.com/itchio). As their utility has been
archived/deprecated without one clear path forward, this project aims to fill in
as a "close enough" successor.
